<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a VERY Introvertive person.But once I get to know a person and become there friends I start revealing my true colours.<br />
    MUA HA HA HA HAAAA.
    Not something to write on a website but sure.
   Jokes apart you don't wanna see my true colours.
  LOL</p>

  <hr />

  <p>OK so basically I am a honest person.
    I try to learn new skills,gain knowledge almost on a daily basis( if not I get a revision done ),I workout,learn programming <br />
    languages and pretty much new skills that a person that has my type of interests should be advanced in or should know on a   <br />
    level.
    I am currently trying to start finding financial knowledge but I actually am swamped honestly, in between learning C++ and   <br />
    Web Development and my EAMCET Counselling.<br />
    Hopefully when I am done with my Counselling, I can get a job at amazon and just finally learn what I have ACTUALLY wanted to learn.<br />
